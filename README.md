I'm a software architect with solid experience in .NET technologies and Web. Always trying to provide the best software solutions using the latest and greatest. I have designed and developed solutions to integrate distributed systems using .NET; implemented some DevOps practices such as: continuous integration, release management, test automation, quality assurance, code review; and provided technical leadership across several projects. I currently work using microservices based architectures and event based architectures.
I'm always interested in improving my know-how by following the latest tech, exploring new features and applying it to my new projects.
